## Docker Images

Docker images are built manually using the provided scripts in the `docker/scripts/` directory:

- **Local Development**: `./docker/scripts/build-docker-local.sh` - Build images locally for testing
- **Production Release**: `./docker/scripts/build-and-push-docker.sh` - Build and push to Docker Hub

See [`docker/scripts/README.md`](docker/scripts/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.
